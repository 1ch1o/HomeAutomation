# ESP8266 Relais-Set MQTT

A simple example how to use a Relais-Set with the ESP8266.\
The code mainly uses code from [mertenats' Open-Home-Automation repository](https://github.com/mertenats/Open-Home-Automation)

NOTE: You have to add a board-manager-URL to your IDE as shown [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/how-to-install-esp8266-board-arduino-ide/).\
Also you have to set the ESP into Flash-Mode.
I suggest to look at this [instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/ESP8266-Programming-Using-FTDI-and-Arduino-IDE/).\
Befor Flashing check if FlashMode is set to DOUT.
