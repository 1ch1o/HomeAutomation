# HomeAutomation
A Script-Collection for HomeAutomation with Hassio, MQTT, ESP8266, Nodemcu etc.


In the next weeks, months and so on, i will post Scripts here i use to do my HomeAutomation and so on.

This is my first repository, so sorry if not all is perfect :)

Script 1: Arduino IDE-Script to turn ON and OFF a "Relais-Set ESP8266" as MQTT-Client. (no soldering required)

NOTE: You have to add a board-manager-URL to your IDE as shown [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/how-to-install-esp8266-board-arduino-ide/).
Also you have to set the ESP into Flash-Mode. (i suggest to look at this [instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/ESP8266-Programming-Using-FTDI-and-Arduino-IDE/).
Befor Flashing check if FlashMode is set to DOUT.
